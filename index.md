## HOMEWORK

There are three homework assignments. Students must turn in their own work on the due day. Homework that is turned in up to 24 hours late will be deducted by 10%. Homework that is turned in between 1 day and 1 week late will be deducted by 50%. Homework that is essentially copy of another student’s assignment will be deducted by 100%.

## ATTENDANCE

Attendance in all classes is required. Students with more than 3 unexcused absences will not receive a passing grade in the class. An unexcused absence is any absence for which the instructor was not notified before the start of the class. If instructor does not show up on-time for class, students are expected to wait at least 15 minutes before leaving.

## DISABILITY ACCESS STATEMENT 

It is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities. Students are encouraged to contact Student Disability Services to discuss their individual needs for accommodation. 

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT 

As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson's vision of this institution as a “high seminary of learning.” Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.
